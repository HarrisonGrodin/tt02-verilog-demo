  top_module:  "HarrisonGrodin_collatz"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
